# Tourism AI Assignment

Hi! This is my solution for the Inkle Tourism AI backend task. I built a Node.js API that helps plan trips by answering travel queries.

## How This Works

- The backend listens for trip questions using a POST request to `/plan`.
- https://inkle-assignment-ai-intern.vercel.app/ Please use this frontend to submit your travel queries and see the results instantly.

## Note: The backend for this project is hosted on Render. If the service has been inactive, it may take up to 30 seconds for the backend to wake up and respond when you access the preview. Please wait for the backend to become active if you experience any delay
